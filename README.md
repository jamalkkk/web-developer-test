# APPS

## Setup 

```bash

## Duration
The entire project build took around 3 days - about 8 hours each day. 

## Improvement
For the sake of this challenge's time and prioritisations, I have left some tasks off which I was quite keen on implementing. These include:

- Separating `vuejs` files into separate `html`, `scss` and `js`
- Make more use of predefined and reusable Bootstrap classes.
- Limit manually edited quantity to a number within range (0 - `stockLevel`)
- Implement an animation counter for prices when the value change (library: https://codesandbox.io/s/8256nwlq78)
- Add a parallax effects to image when scrolling
- Show a subtle animation to text and icon buttons on hover and active
- Add store to manage states of the bought items
- Include unit tests, esspically on `Summary.vue` component. (I only created one basic test)

## Notes

Some notes that I want to share:
- I spent quite some time on setting up the project, not because it was difficult, but rather because sometime I tend to spend too much time on little things such structuring files and naming them.
- I really wanted to add more life into the project using more smooth transtions and animations; however, I focused more on meeting the basic requirments of the challenge.

I have enjoyed building this challenge and, I hope you find it satisfactory - Thank you for this opportunity.
